# Walkie-Lookie
We've all thought "why don't walkie talkies send photos?", well I thought about it too, and decided to answer it.
## A LoRa based image sender.
By far the most difficult project I've ever built, requiring lots of research, testing, and doing things nobody has ever done before. Starting out with SSTV encoding directly playing through walkie talkies, and eventually turning into plain bytes flowing through a LoRa module from an ESP32-CAM, this project has been what I've had in mind for the past 3 months.
